🚀 Launching Project Sentinel-SLM: Building the Future of Autonomous AI Security 🛡️

The AI revolution is here, but so are its vulnerabilities. As we move from static LLMs to autonomous AI agents, the attack surface has expanded beyond traditional security's reach. Today, I’m excited to share **Project Sentinel-SLM**, a technical deep-dive into the future of AI defense.

Project Sentinel-SLM is an autonomous dual-agent system designed to solve the critical "Context vs. Latency" tradeoff in AI security.

💡 **The Innovation:**
Instead of relying on slow, expensive generic LLMs, I developed a specialized 8B parameter Small Language Model (SLM). By fine-tuning Llama-3 using #Unsloth and #QLoRA, the system achieves:
✅ **96% Detection Accuracy** for jailbreaks and prompt injections.
✅ **Sub-100ms Inference** (30x faster than industry baselines).
✅ **Autonomous Mitigation** via #LangGraph agentic reasoning.

⚔️ **The Architecture:**
The system features an adversarial loop where a Red Team Agent generates novel attacks to challenge a Blue Team Agent. When a threat is detected, the Blue Team autonomously invokes security tools (network scanners, firewall blockers) to neutralize the threat in real-time.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- **Model:** Llama-3 8B (Meta)
- **Frameworks:** LangGraph, LangChain, FastAPI
- **Optimization:** Unsloth, QLoRA
- **Deployment:** Docker & Kubernetes ready

This project isn’t just about code—it’s a move toward self-healing, autonomous security layers for the agentic era.
